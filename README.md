# ü´Å Lung Cancer Prediction System

## üìå Overview

This project predicts **lung cancer risk** based on patient details such as **age, gender, smoking history, exposure to harmful substances, COPD diagnosis and family history**.
It uses **Random Forest**, **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**, and **1D CNN** models to classify patients as high-risk or low-risk, with probabilities for each prediction.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Description

The dataset `lung_cancer_dataset.csv` contains **50,000 rows** and the following columns:

| Column                          | Type    | Description                                              |

| **gender**                      | object  | Male/Female ‚Üí encoded as 1/0                             |
| **pack\_years**                 | float64 | Smoking history (packs/day √ó years)                      |
| **radon\_exposure**             | object  | Low/Medium/High ‚Üí encoded as 1/2/3                       |
| **asbestos\_exposure**          | object  | Yes/No ‚Üí encoded as 1/0                                  |
| **secondhand\_smoke\_exposure** | object  | Yes/No ‚Üí encoded as 1/0                                  |
| **copd\_diagnosis**             | object  | Yes/No ‚Üí encoded as 1/0                                  |
| **alcohol\_consumption**        | object  | Dropped after preprocessing                              |
| **family\_history**             | object  | Yes/No ‚Üí encoded as 1/0                                  |
| **lung\_cancer**                | object  | Yes/No ‚Üí encoded as 1/0 (target variable)                |

### Data Preprocessing

* Removed unnecessary columns (`patient_id`, `alcohol_consumption`)
* Encoded categorical features to numeric values
* Converted string exposures to numeric scales (e.g., `radon_exposure`)
* Checked for missing values and cleaned dataset

---

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Histograms for all features to understand distributions
* Boxplots to detect outliers and visualize spread
* Correlation heatmap to inspect feature relationships

---

## Modeling

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Random Forest

* Trained using **RandomForestClassifier**
* Evaluated with **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score**
* Confusion matrix plotted to visualize predictions

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

* Built using **TensorFlow Keras**
* Architecture: Dense(64) ‚Üí Dropout(0.3) ‚Üí Dense(32) ‚Üí Dense(1, Sigmoid)
* Trained with **binary crossentropy** loss and **Adam optimizer**
* Evaluated on test set with metrics and confusion matrix

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ 1D CNN

* Built using **Conv1D layers + GlobalMaxPooling + Dense layers**

## Model Performance

| Model            | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
| ---------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| Random Forest    | 0.7006   | 0.688     | 0.7006 | 0.693    |
| MLP              | 0.7321   | 0.715     | 0.7321 | 0.713    |
| 1D CNN           | 0.7316   | 0.714     | 0.7316 | 0.704    |

> Metrics are calculated on the **train set** to evaluate model performance.

## User Input Prediction

Users can input patient details:

* Age
* Gender (0=Female, 1=Male)
* Pack Years (Smoking history)
* Radon Exposure (1=Low, 2=Medium, 3=High)
* Asbestos Exposure (0=No, 1=Yes)
* Secondhand Smoke Exposure (0=No, 1=Yes)
* COPD Diagnosis (0=No, 1=Yes)
* Family History (0=No, 1=Yes)

The system predicts:

* **Lung Cancer Risk**: Yes/No

---
